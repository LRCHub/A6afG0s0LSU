You open up the door i feel a breeze
I see you constant please please please
You call it love when you break all the rules
I pray to the one to the one that understood
This is a song for the dead in my family
For all the long gone waiting there for me
Your not telling the truth are you
Are we falling in to this tonight
You move your body for the last fight
You call it to leave me all alone
Look in to my eyes i can't do this anymore
This is a song for the dead in my family
For all the long gone waiting there for me
Your not telling the truth are you
This is a song for the dead in my family
For all the long gone waiting there for me
Your not telling the truth are you
If you only want the good times
(Not your voice not your choice)
If you only want the best
(Not your voice not your choice)
This is a song for the dead in my family
For all the long gone waiting there for me
(not your voice)
Your not telling the truth are you
(Not your voice not your choice)
This is a song for the dead in my family
For all the long gone waiting there for me
(Not your voice)
Your not telling the truth are you
This is a song for the dead in my family
For all the long gone waiting there for me
(Not your voice)
Your not telling the truth are you
(Not your voice not your choice)
